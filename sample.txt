The fox: "If you come at four in the afternoon, I'll begin to be happy at three. By four I'll be all aquiver with expectation. I'll stand on tiptoe, I'll begin to feel happy. And at the last minute, I'll dash madly away to meet you."
The fox: "It means that if you come at four o'clock in the afternoon, I'll begin to be happy at three. By four, I'll be all aquiver with expectation. I'll stand on tiptoe, I'll begin to feel happy. And at the last minute, I'll dash madly away to meet you."
The Little Prince: "I don't understand."
The fox: "It's the time that matters. If you come at the same time every day, I'll come to meet you at that time. And then, little by little, we'll begin to know each other."
